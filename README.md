# Algorithm Data Structure Warmup Template  
This repo provides template for algorithm data structure cource exercises

### Proposed repo structure
```bash
.
|-- sprint1/
|-- |-- exercise1/
|-- |-- |-- exercice1.cpp
|-- |-- exercise2/
|-- |-- |-- exercice2.java
|-- |-- exercise3/

```

### Contributing
It's not allowed to push directly to `main` branch. Delivery to `main` done through pull requests.
> Note: Linear history required. Branch you accept pull request from will be automatically removed after merge.
1. Create a Feature Branch: Before making changes, create a feature branch where you'll work on your changes. You can create a new branch using the following command:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```
2. Make Changes: Make your changes in the feature branch, commit them, and push the feature branch to the remote repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push -u origin feature-branch
```
3. Create Pull Request: After pushing your changes to the feature branch, go to your GitHub repository's page and create a pull request from your feature branch into the main branch.
4. Merge Pull Request: Review the changes in the pull request, and once approved, you can merge it into the main branch through the GitHub interface.
